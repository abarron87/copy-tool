# copy-tool
An Angular tool for previewing text on banners of varying dimensions.

To test it out, simply clone the repo, install node and bower dependencies and run "grunt serve".

You can add other dimensions by uncommenting them in /app/scripts/services/banners.js.

Filtering is then done by either typing the name (in dimensions) or by the size checkboxes.

## works with plain text and HTML

Enter text into the first box for those banners which are deemed big enough for the long copy. The second box is for an abbreviated version.

## built with angular and scaffolded by the yeoman angular generator

Built with Angular JS for its awesome two-way-data-binding

## views are written in Jade

webstorm watcher converted to html.
